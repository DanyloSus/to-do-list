# To do list

[The live site](https://to-do-list-indol-sigma.vercel.app/)

## Why is it (site) existing?

Hello!:wave:
I am **Danylo Sushko**. I am a **_Front-End React Developer_**.
I'm looking for a **job** so I wanted to create **something** to show what I know.:cowboy_hat_face:

## What is the project

It is my first Full-Stack App. 
A simple To-Do List, where you can register, login, and save To-Dos locally and on a server.

## What have I used?

I have created the **_To Do List_ **on **React** with some **libraries**.
I have used:
  1. **Next JS 14 version, App routing** (for routing, server-side rendering, etc.)
  2. **Mongo DB** (for DB) and **Mongoose** (for interactions with the DB)
  3. **TypeScript** (for typization and creating a better understanding of the project)
  4. **Material UI** (for creating themes and simple creating elements)
  5. **Figma** (for creating UI/UX design)
  6. **Formik** (for forms) and **Yup** (for validating the forms)
  7. Connected **Redux** for global disables, errors, loadings, and burger menu.
  8. Main rules of **responsive design**.
  9. **Axios** (for better and faster writing HTTP calls)
  10. **React-MD** (for ToDo thing's content)
  11. **React Typed** (for start page)
  12. **Bcrypt** (for hashing passwords) and **DayJS** (for work with experimental time element of Material UI)

Thank **you** for reading my **_README_**! :sunglasses::call_me_hand::thumbsup:
